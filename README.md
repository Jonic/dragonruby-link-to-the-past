# Info

I want to try to create "Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" using a 2D game engine called DragonRuby Game Toolkit.

# How to Run

1. You need a license to [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](http://dragonruby.org) (**income assistance is provided to those who can't afford to pay**).
2. Download the code here and put all the files under the `mygame` directory located in the Game Toolkit environment.
3. Run `./dragonruby` to launch the game.
4. Change code to see the updates reflected live.

Happy to accept PRs. I occasionally code live on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/amirrajan).
